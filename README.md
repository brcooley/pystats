# pystats - Simple stat functions for data manipulation #

### Why? ###
[numpy][np] and [scipy][sp] offer an amazing amount of powerful statistics, but sometimes 
you just need the basics, and don't want to rely on something as heavy as numpy.  pystats 
should be as simple as `import stats`, and give you access to a number of simple statistical 
functions.
